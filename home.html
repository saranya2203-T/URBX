    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section class="intro">
      <p>URBX builds Planning Intelligence systems for governments. We design software that converts urban planning from
        a manual, document-driven exercise into a continuous, computational decision process.
        Our systems enable cities to analyse land, housing, regulation, and policy outcomes at speed, with consistency,
        and without dependence on repetitive human workflows.
        Planning Intelligence is the layer between urban data and urban decisions. While cities today generate vast
        amounts of spatial and socio-economic data, planning institutions still rely on manual interpretation, ad-hoc
        modelling, and static reports.
        URBX restructures this gap by encoding planning logic into machine-executable systems that governments can run,
        test, and evolve over time.
        Unlike traditional planning firms, URBX does not prepare plans. We build the intelligence infrastructure that
        allows cities to plan for themselves.
        Our products replace repetitive analytical labour with automated evaluation engines, enabling planners to focus
        on judgment, policy intent, and governance rather than mechanical processing.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT URBX – HORIZONTAL DIVISION -->
    <section class="about-urbx-horizontal">

      <div class="about-row">
        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          URBX Plans and Research is an urban planning and spatial research firm
          working across policy, data, and spatial intelligence to deliver
          grounded and implementable planning solutions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-row">
        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          We believe planning must respond to lived realities.
          Our work prioritizes spatial equity, environmental sensitivity,
          and governance feasibility over abstract master plans.
          Cities are complex systems, and planning must be resilient to that complexity.
          URBX believes that planning should rely on structured intelligence rather than individual effort, systems
          rather than documents, and continuity rather than repetition.
          Strong planning institutions require strong internal tools, not perpetual external dependency.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-row">
        <h3>Why We are Different</h3>
        <p>
          URBX integrates rigorous research, spatial analytics, and field-based
          understanding to produce context-specific urban frameworks
          rather than generic templates.Most urban technology platforms focus on data visualisation or monitoring. Most
          planning firms focus on final reports and drawings.
          URBX focuses on the intelligence layer beneath both.
          We build the systems that generate decisions, not just the artefacts that describe them.
          Our work is product-led rather than consultancy-led, infrastructure-oriented rather than project-oriented, and
          designed for long-term public capacity rather than short-term delivery.
          We avoid generic dashboards, opaque algorithms, and technology hype, focusing instead on clarity,
          reproducibility, and institutional relevance.</p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>
              URBX is a planning systems company operating at the intersection of
              urban planning, public policy, and computational design. We convert
              procedural planning frameworks into scalable software used internally
              by governments. We do not deliver one-off consultancy outputs. We build
              long-term planning infrastructure grounded in real regulatory and
              institutional constraints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              We treat planning as an operational system, not a static document.
              URBX restructures how planning decisions are made by translating
              real-world workflows into rule-based, explainable analytical pipelines.
              Human judgment stays central—manual repetition does not. Transparency,
              accountability, and policy control are non-negotiable.
            </p>

          <div class="info-card highlight">
            <h3>Why URBX</h3>
            <p>
              We bridge planning theory and on-ground implementation through
              people-centric, institution-ready systems that actually work.
